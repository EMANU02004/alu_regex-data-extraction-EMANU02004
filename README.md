# alu_regex-data-extraction-EMANU02004

This project demonstrates how to use regular expressions (regex) to extract and validate structured data from large volumes of raw text, similar to data returned by an external API.

The focus is on accuracy, robust handling of real-world input, and basic security awareness when dealing with untrusted text data

# Data types extracted
.URLs
.Phone numbers
.Time values(both 12 & 24-hour formats)
.Credit card numbers
.Email addresses
